Making a payment with PayPal account that is not yet linked to a credit card would seem almost impossible. Before I linked my credit card to my PayPal account I really had a tough time. Nearly 70% of online payments would request your credit card. However, those which you pay directly from PayPal do exist too.

With those you pay directly; you just have to deposit money to your PayPal.

**How do you deposit money/send money to PayPal without credit card/bank account?**

Here is what you do; it's quite some steps but it helps

* From your PayPal Account click send&request.
* Enter email of the person or account you want payment from.
* Request the amount you want and submit.

Now here is the trick!!

In the case where you're to send money or make payment, tell your payee to 'request you'. 

When you receive the request just click pay.

Do the same way to deposit; request a payment from a friend with a linked account with enough cash (settle the debt with him/her with cash).
