  Technological.

   Politics in Kenya is credited more than it should be. Lots of concern has been raised regarding how we handle our politics. It's only in Kenya where an elections takes almost a year to end, campaigns taking 1 year whereas constitution amendments, referendum and other constitutional campaigns taking another year. Literally, we spend half the political term doing nothing constructive while other countries steer their wheel much higher. As Kenyans, we're under-performing.

   Yesterday, my friend asked me to help him with a news app. After spending so much time on google trying to find an API for Kenya news we were convinced we just had to create our own. It's so sad seeing other country's featuring in major worldwide services when yours isn't with them. 

  So I sat down and did my research. Why should Kenyan starting websites have to wait for so long to be approved by Adsense? Why don't we have high school kids, university students seeing their startups grow to something beyond their own imagination? Why not just offer jobs to promising talented youngsters? I mean, some jobs do not really require 5 years experience, others just need keenness and openness. The focus we've granted our politics is draining it all. It's our duty to nature our young generation. 'teach your kid to drive a car and he will buy his',don't take my word for it, we need to nurture our young generations into creating opportunities for themselves, come up with innovations that will change the world. If other kids somewhere else in some first class country can do it then why can't we? What's the difference? It's all in our way of life, if we watch billion shillings scandals on news everyday and while the first class country watches billion dollar buy-outs, million dollar partnerships to startups then how can we really think in the same manner? 

You think of it, we glorify politicians and money launders more than our own businessmen. This is why Vision 2030 is not coming any soon, Tatu city will just be mystery and we'll continue living in shadows of other people success.

Technological innovation is the key to brighter future. If we need to have a say, be a superpower, talk and be listened to then we have to earn it. How many years since we began exporting coffee and tea? So long, yet no one ever thinks its time we add more to it for a more positive change in results. If we embrace technology and reward innovations Kenya will be a much better country.
