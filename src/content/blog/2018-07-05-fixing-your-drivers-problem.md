The following are the common bugs in drivers I have encountered in person;

* Bluetooth crashing
* Sound card not working
* Graphics update

I'll let you know of how I went about each one of them.

(a). Bluetooth

I was using a Lenovo ideapad 320 and was having a real headache with my Bluetooth for quite some time. I tried using **Drivers Pack** app to update the Bluetooth drivers but it didn't give me a long term solution as it would crash there after. However, I believe it may work for others, but for those like me...Other updates from** lenovo site** and **driver booster5 **also had a similar effect. So, this is what I did;

* Go to 'device manager'
* At the view drop-down click 'show hidden files'
* uninstall Bluetooth (if you don't see it in the list Go to 'network adapter' then right click and uninstall all Bluetooth drivers one after the other)
* Using Drivers Pack, Driver Booster5 or from your laptop website install the Bluetooth driver for your laptop and windows).

**Note: **Try updating first before considering the above process.

(b). Sound card

With the sound card not working you have two options.

* Go to 'device manager'
* At the view drop-down click 'show hidden files'
* Select 'audio input and output'/'audio'
* Right click speakers and select 'properties'
* From the speaker pop-up menu select driver column 
* Update driver( or if it worked properly before which means you had a previous update working fine the click 'roll back driver'

(c). Graphics

With graphics I honestly recommend you to try Driver Booster5 at least that's what I use with that and it works fine. Click to [download](https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php).
