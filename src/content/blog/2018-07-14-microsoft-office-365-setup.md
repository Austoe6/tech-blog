Welcome back! From the suggestions I got, I figured I should share with you this tutorial on how to get our Microsoft Office 365 ready. If you have been using any Microsoft Office product for a while you probably have faced problems with your copy getting outdated. Sometimes these problems get us in fine moments when you're not actually in constant use sometimes not. Well, that's fine. The universe is so much diversified and what I do is not necessarily what you might consider doing.

This is why I came up with several ways you can go about when you need to access any Microsoft Office service. There are three ways about it;

Your PC need to meet the following minimum requirements:

1. Operating System: Windows 7/8/8.1/10
2. Memory (RAM): 1GB of RAM required
3. Hard Disk Space: 3GB of free space required
4. Processor: 1GHz processor or faster

The first one is pretty obvious and is what I insist should be your way to go about this;

## A). Buying your new copy

You can visit the official Microsoft site a buy your copy:

Personal goes for $69.99 per year

Office 365 Home $99.99 per year

Office home & student PC $149.99 per year.

Choose either according to your needs and specifications you need. When you done paying you can download and install easily with ISO.

## B). Use the online/live version

You can access any Microsoft service for free so long as you have a Microsoft account online.

Click [here](https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx).

You do your work online then save it to cloud or download it to your PC.

## C). Install for free!!!

You can download and install most of these Microsoft Office program;

Go to [getintopc](https://www.techgenius.me/2018-07-10-how-to-install-windows-10-for-free/) and download the copy you need.

I'll use 'Office 365 small Business Premium' from getintopc with the following features;

1. _Software Full Name: Office 365 Small Business Premium
   _
2. _Setup File Name: Office_365_Small_Business_Premium.zip
   _
3. _Full Setup Size: 999 MB
   _
4. _Setup Type: Offline Installer / Full Standalone Setup
   _
5. _Compatibility Architecture: 32 Bit (x86) / 64 Bit (x64)
   _
6. _Latest Version Release Added On: 5th Dec 2014
   _

Most of these downloads have a video tutorial though.

When your download is complete extract the file in one folder > Click 'read me' and note the setup file you should run first > when the setup is complete install the patch file > run patch > you are set to go.

That's how you go about your Microsoft Office. Please leave a comment for any suggestion or email me for inquiry and personal assistance.
