The Safaricom-PayPal  deal is the best deal we've ever had from Safaricom as Freelancers or any other person constantly making transactions internationally.

To link your m-pesa is much easier, you just have to follow the steps as guided like any other sign up process. All you need is a PayPal account which should not be necessarily link to your bank account as required for most payments.

Transaction rates are much cheaper, a deposit to PayPal is charged like any other PayBill deposit. The PayPal paybill is 800088. The rates are;

* Ksh. 00-99 _free_
* Ksh. 100-999_ sh.23_
* Ksh.1000-2499 _sh.34_
* Ksh. 2500-4999_ sh.56_
* Ksh. 5000-9999 _sh.85_
* Ksh. 10000-34999 _sh.112_
* Ksh. 35000-49999 _sh.202_
* Ksh. 50000-70000 _sh.210_

Tranfer rates from PayPal to M-Pesa charges are billed by Safaricom not PayPal; you can withdraw all you want!

The transfer time span for PayPal to Safaricom is a little quicker, about 1-4 hours. At other times, however, it may take upto 48 hours.
