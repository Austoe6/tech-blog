The Safaricom-PayPal  deal is the best deal we've ever had from Safaricom as Freelancers or any other person constantly making transactions internationally.

To link your m-pesa is very easy, you just have to follow the steps as guided like any other sign up process. All you need is a PayPal account which should not be necessarily link to your bank account as required for most payments.

Transaction rates are much cheaper, to deposit to PayPal is charged as any other PayBill deposit. The PayPal paybill is 800088.

Tranfer rates from PayPal to M-Pesa charges are billed with Safaricom not PayPal; which is good as you can as well withdraw as little as you can.

The transfer time span for PayPal to Safaricom is a little quicker, about 1-4 hours. At other times, however, it may take upto 48 hours.
