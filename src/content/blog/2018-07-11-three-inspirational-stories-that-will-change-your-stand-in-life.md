These short inspirational stories might change your life for good;

## (a). What's Happiness?

There lived this old mad in a village. He was a distress to everyone in the village and no one had love for him, not even a bit. He would spend every word from his mouth cursing and speaking havoc all day. The longer he lived, the repulsive he became and more poisonous were his words. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others. The villagers did their best to have him isolated from the rest of the clan.



Then he turned 90 and a miracle happened. His personality suddenly changed overnight. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumor: “The old man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.”

The whole village gathered around the man and asked him, “What happened to you?”



The old man replied, “Nothing special my sons and daughters. Ninety years I’ve been chasing happiness and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.”

**Moral: **_Sometimes we spend a lot of our time worrying about how to be just happy when happiness is about 'not worrying about anything at all'._

## (b). The army of frogs

An army of frogs were traveling through the forest when three of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that there was no hope left for them.



However, the three frogs ignored their comrades and proceeded to try to jump out of the pit. However, despite their efforts, the group of frogs at the top of the pit were still saying that they should just give up as they’d never make it out.



Eventually, two of the frogs took heed of what the others were saying and he gave up, jumping even deeper to his death. The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the group of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and to just die.



He ignored them, and jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?”



The frog explained to them that he was deaf, and that he thought they were encouraging him the entire time.

**Moral: **_People's words will impact our life heavily, we therefore have to learn what to filter and what to take heed. People will always talk whether you do good or wrong. We also need to be careful what we tell others as it may have a life time impact to them._

## (c). Worrying won't solve your problems

People visit a wise man complaining about the same problems over and over again. One day, he decided to tell them a joke and they all roared with laughter.



After a few minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled.



Then he told the same joke for a third time, but no one laughed or smiled anymore.



The wise man smiled and said: “You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem?”

**Moral: **We need to face our problems head-on, worrying about them won't change anything.
