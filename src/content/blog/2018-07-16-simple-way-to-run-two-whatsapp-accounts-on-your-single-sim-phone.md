## WhatsApp?

WhatsApp is a free messaging app owned by Facebook. With it's increasing popularity there's been a rising concern on WhatsApp usage. We've always wanted more. 

I remember a few years back, with my Samsung Galaxy J7 times were so hard on me. I had just lost my dual sim phone and having a single sim phone with two sim cards proved a little bit hectic as I had to change sim each time I needed to access the other. Changing WhatsApp account each time wasn't an option. It's too tedious even to think of.

## Multi-account Apps: Not Really a Savior!

Then, I stumble upon some Multi-accounts applications on Google Play Store. This was miracle I was just waiting for. At least that's what I thought then. After installing a number of them here is what I got;

* Crashes
* Tedious
* Not really what I/you want

All these apps seemed to have been rushed to the market due to high demand, no customer experience catered for, no passion and no customization! All what we both care for dearly.

You can try them: Multi-Accounts, Dual Space, Clone Space and so on.

## Corner-stone at last!!

If you have a single sim or dual sim and you want to have two WhatsApp accounts on your phone it's simple. 

Download and install WhatsApp from Play Store. Then Click [here](https://www.techgenius.me/2018-06-25-install-whatsapp-on-blackberry-for-free-whatsapp10-is-not-the-only-option/) to download GB WhatsApp.

Install your GB WhatsApp and enter your other phone no.

Make sure the phone no. is online to receive the six digits confirmation code.

Key them in.

You are set to go.

You can change icon appearance not to confuse the two WhatsApp on your phone.
