It's so frustrating having a BlackBerry phone when ID is someone else, or just forgot the password and recovery password too. Here is what you need to do;

* Press and hold power button and volume Down button simultaneously.
* Use the Volume down to navigate.
* Select 'wipe data/factory rest' using Volume Up.

other ways;

* Enter password 10 times
* Enter 'Blackberry'
* Enter any keywords.
