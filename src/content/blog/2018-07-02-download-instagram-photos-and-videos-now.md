Good moments pass our eyes everyday yet we can't save it for some other time or for someone else. The question of how to download Instagram photos and videos has been answered in different ways.

There are extensions and apps put in place to help you out on this but it's just too much of work. Some people even pay for it.

Others would take screenshot unfortunately you can't screenshot a video. The solution is simple;

With the GBInsta version of Instagram you can have more fun without limits. I'm using it and would give it a plus.

**NOTE:** The above download version is experiencing some bugs as of late. Stay in touch, I'll let you know when it's fixed.

However, the whatsapp version is super cool! With all the themes and freedom you want, I give it all for customization.
