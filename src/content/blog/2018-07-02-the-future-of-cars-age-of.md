Nearly 80% of the world's major technological advancements have been achieved in past 100 years. Better automation technology has been achieved. Automation was dated back to the mid 17s' and was divided in eras based on the means of propulsion;

* Nicholas Joseph's steam power engine.
* Francoi'z Isaac Hydrogen internal combustion engine.
* Marcus first Gasoline powered engine

Several invention came in between before our present modern car. Most advancements currently are defined in interior trends; styling, size and utilities. We've seen the Limosines, Range rover series, Rolls Royce and so on... More advancements in the sports car came with speed. 

_**All surface cars**_

In the coming future, we'll be seeing all surface cars. Don't mistake it for flying; flying cars sound more optimistic even for me and you. The all surface car will move on all surface of the earth; water and land.

I know there have been floating cars make but honestly they are not yet there. Bridges won't be of much use to private car owners, would probably be left for the trucks and heavy load vehicles. With All surface cars, there would be less traffic, waterways will be defined for this cars. There would be water 'Traffic officers'!

Wait for it, all surface cars are coming!
