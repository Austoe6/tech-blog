This is a huge step too for the government, in addition in its [attempt to promote local assembling industries at Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers in Thika](https://www.nation.co.ke/business/Volkswagen-unveils-Sh1-65m-car-as-it-launches-plant-in-Thika/996-3494114-papy0c/index.html) where it committed itself to buying 300 units from the dealers each year.

Posta Kenya is also expected to receive more vehicles from other companies; 11 Isuzu Dmax and eight-six others to complete their fleet this year.
