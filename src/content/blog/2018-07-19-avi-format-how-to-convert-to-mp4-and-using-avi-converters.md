## What’s AVI?

AVI stands for Audio Video Interleave. From the name we now are sure it entails both video and audio data. These data are stored in a container which allow audio-video playback synchronization. AVI files were first introduced by Microsoft way back in 1992. They are therefore supported in all Microsoft products. They have file extensions .avi developed by Matrox OpenDML group since February 1996.

AVI is part of Resource Exchange File Format (RIFF) which organizes data in grouped forms ‘blocks’. These blocks identify themselves in FourCC tag which are differentiated from each other file. The data encoded in these blocks, though, can be encoded or decoded using a software known as codec. This basically explains why you may have an AVI file supported by your player when the next isn’t supported at all. See [AVI Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/directshow/avi-file-format) too.

## AVI usage

At its kick-off, AVI technology was used entirely as a file container by Microsoft to support its operating system video and audio file. 

With rapid growth in technology, more specifically internet penetration, AVI became more common up-to-date with over 10 billion video files, we have millions of AVI formats out there all over the internet. There are platforms and technology to read these files. We have Google drive, Youtube and so on.

Offline players like Windows media player and VLC player can play all AVI files without problems. These have facilitated growth of this Video-Audio file format.

## Advantages of AVI files

•	It has an amazing compression score. Advertising videos and promos online opt for AVI as it save on space and loading time due to its small size.

•	It is not dependent on a specific hardware component to operate on. It therefore reliable for personal use, not much capital is spent to operate these files.

•	It can run on any Windows platform. Windows world-wide coverage is exemplary, with a format readable by a large percentage of the world is plus.

•	A bank of codecs are currently available i.e DivX and XviD hence increasing its compression score against other video formats.

•	It can easily be made compatible with the DV standards. This is achieved through compressing DV-AVI.

## Limitations/cons of AVI

•	Using AVI could be stressful at times, you player can play several AVI files and at the same time fail to play other AVI files. This is because these files are compressed using some codecs which may not be available in your player. Even though having these codecs installed in your player could be an easy task, everything is difficult if you have no idea about it and thus cause so much frustrations among AVI users.

•	Since there are a lot of codecs available, for you to consider quality you will have to spend a lot of time experimenting on the best to use for your data. 

•	Most of these files may have poor user experience. For example, some may not allow ‘continue play’ click on pauses, or skip play.

•	On the worst case, when AVI files are not compressed as they should be, they occupy so much space. If you don’t want to run out of storage you’ll have to sacrifice more of your storage space.

•	Too much of compression on these file tamper with the quality of output which should in fact be the concern as at present since everybody is out to get the best quality; 4K/2K/1080p video quality is what everyone wants today.

AVI against the other Video formats;

## Comparison between AVI, MPEG and MOV.

**MPEG** the initials for Moving Pictures Expert Group is a group of experts formed by ISO and IEC. Their main goal is to spearhead audio and video compression broadcasting. The group came earlier than AVI back in 1988 in Ottawa. 

![MPEG](/img/mpeg.jpg)

**MOV**; it was introduced in 1998 by Apple. It is basically an MPEG 4 video format in Apple’s QuickTime program.

## AVI vs MPEG

If you intend to have a wonderful PC/ Mac experience AVI is definitely your way. It possess high quality; you can have uncompressed video files for editing and offers a long term solution to your storage concerns. If you are video editor, photographer or film producer AVI is your way.

On the other hand, MPEG video files are more common in the internet. Basically, they are the dominants here. They serve to facilitate internet sharing and mobile phones compatibility. So I suggest, YouTubers  and digital marketers take a keen look on this here.

## AVI vs MOV

With MOVs, they are more of alike when it comes to pros, cons and uses. They are the most compatible PC or Mac video format we all need. However, when uncompressed they are pretty too big and would go up to ~26GB per 120 sec of footage! This renders them irrelevant for video playback.

Also, they are durable and would probably suit you if you intend to store your files for future years to come. You can store these files using external storage devices in the market. They shouldn’t cost you much.

## How open AVI file; AVI Video Players

Whenever you run into trouble opening AVI files format, mostly because you lack required codecs, you should install the required codecs. Click to see[ how to install required codes. ](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-download-codec-files-required-for-playing-media-in-windows-7/)

However, to avoid such kind of problems just have the right player with a guarantee of nearly 90%.

Use Windows Media player, that’s should be your first choice. In the case where Windows media fails you can install free K-Lite Codec Pack.

Other players I would recommend first should be VLC player, DivX player, Kodi and so much more out there.

In the internet, google drive will also work so well with AVI file format.

In the case where you lack either of those, or they all fail due to one reason or the other, you may consider converting them to other formats readable by your device be it PC, Mac or TV.
