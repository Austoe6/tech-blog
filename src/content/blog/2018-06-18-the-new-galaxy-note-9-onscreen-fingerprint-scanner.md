There are numerous allegations, rumors and mass expectations from the media of the Samsung Note 9, believed to be released early September this year. The leaks highlighted its in-screen fingerprint scanner, internal memory of 512GB, screen-size of 6.28 inch and a RAM of 8GB as the score points. It's amazing! I mean, you're buying a phone, right? With features even better than your laptop...

Until all that is confirmed, it's just expectations. However, it is certain the Samsung Note 9 will be the Samsung hero in the second half of 2018. In regards, it will be released earlier before the release of Apple's iphone X2 or the iphone 9. This is focus more attention to it. Usual the Note series come when the hype is all about the expected iphone thus the change this year. 

The S-pen is not expected to change this year. It's functions and space it occupies is just enough. We don't want the pen to reduce the size of battery,expected to be 3850 mAh, or other components in that matter. It's more like the label in your shoes, you just can't buy without it even though you don't really use it that much. The S-pen makes the Note series complete; it's the next generation value to it and fun to use. 

A few Geekbench leaks pegged its single-core performance to 2411 and multi-core performance at 8806. If this is confirmed, the note 9 will have a slightly better performance than  U.S versions of Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+.

Again, the Note 9 is not expected to rise to high at release cost from its predecessors and so explains the eagerness and impatience among customers. At almost the same cost, you will have more amazing experience and unlimited options for basic functions in your phone. It is expected to fall around $930 to $950.
