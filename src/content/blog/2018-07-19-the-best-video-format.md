What is the best video format for my download? Why all these options anyway? What is the real difference between MP4 and MKV or AVI and MPEG? I mean literally they all look alike as you stream your movie or songs. There is no any big gap to identify this is what from the other with our bare eyes. We just have to check the details. So, come to think of it, if the quality is the same at least from our eyes judgement then why should I pick this over that? We all make our judgement on quality, right?

The most important thing you need to get to your head is that these video formats are not only extensions. I have discussed about AVI earlier and it’s clear they consist of codecs, [AVI formats](http://bit.ly/2O1ui3v) are in fact containers. So, to understand this question so well we need to understand these two terms.

For comparison between these video format; AVI against MKV, MP4, MPEG and WEBL see above link.


## Codec

What is a codec?  At one point we either have bought a movie or downloaded one and any other large video file we use. These files would have been much larger if not for codecs. A normal Blu-Ray disc usually takes up to around 35GB to 50GB which is way too large for external storage and would take time to download given a standard internet speed. So, we have to compress them for easy manageability and portability. 

Codec is what we use to compress and decompress our files. However, we have to sacrifice some quality for this to occur as discussed in AVI Format file. Most players have codecs pre-installed to read these files. My personal take is VLC players. It has a wide range of codecs and would play 90% of your video files. Windows Media Player is also a good take, more specific for AVI files.

Codecs available presently include;

•	DivX- works well with MPEG4 

•	XviD- open source DivX

•	FFmpeg- this include two formats MPEG2 for DVDs and MPEG4 mostly used by Apple’s iTune movies.

•	MPEG4 AVC mostly used in HD videos. (720p/1080p/2K/4K).

So now let’s look at containers.

## Containers

A container is a group of files which contains a group of video and audio codecs. It also contains subtitle and this is the main difference between a container and a codec. A container basically serves to transport and present audio or video file. It is also a storage unit for codecs. Containers allow you to specify the type of audio or video you want to use for your viewing.

In summary, a container is a metafile format that describes element of data and metadata from a video or audio file.

Containers include AVI, Matroska (MKV), MOV files (Apple’s QuickTime) and MP4.

So, how do we select the best video format?

To arrive at this decision we have to look at each of them separately.

## (a). QuickTime

QuickTime is Apple’s based multimedia format written in C and objective-C. It has good quality video output and efficient for long term storage. 

QuickTime has larger files which may not be the best for the web. It also doesn’t support interactive editing.

It receives appraisals mainly for its diversification, it has high quality performance in almost all streaming formats.

## (b). DV-AVI

It has a high quality video output. It has high compression score too. However, if not compressed these files are too large for usage (about 20-27GB per 60 minutes). 

DV-AVI can also record back to DV tape. They require a high processing power to run on your PC. Definitely not the best for just personal streaming.

## (c).MPEG 2

They have good quality video and would be used best to burn DVD disc.  They have a relative large size about 4.7GB for almost 2 hours.  They produce high quality DVD disk.

## (d). DivX

They are interactive with video editing software. They occupy small storage space with high quality videos. 

They however cannot produce DVD or CDs.

## (e). MPEG-1

It produces standard video quality for video CDs. It’s probably the best for making CDs but it’s quality is lower than MPEG-2.

## (f). Real Video

It’s a good format for streaming. They are of low size with good quality picture. It has a good compression score. It requires a special playback software. RealVideo also does not support editing. It was previously used for video streaming. Not so common today.

## (g). WMV

There is no any big difference between WMV and RealVideo. It is also ideal for web transmission. It is supported by Microsoft and can be viewed with Windows Media Player.

## (h). FLV

FLV stands for Flash Video. It uses adobe player to transmit video/audio over the internet. It has been used for long as a standard internet streaming file in YouTube, Vimeo and other services but today it’s not so common with HTML5 superiority over it. This owes to its declining performance these days. Most browsers today are eliminating Flash video extensions from their services. In due time, they will be eliminated completely. We are talking a span of about 2 years-time only.

Having looked at them independently we can now make our judgement.

## 1.	Best High Definition Video for TV screen

If you want videos for PC or TV watching, it’s best if you have the highest quality possible. These file formats may include MOV, MKV and AVI. However, currently these high quality videos are of high storage. Hopefully, things will change soon.

## 2.	Best Video format for DVD burning

As discussed above, the best format to burn DVD is MPEG-2. It’s the most common used these days. You can also use MPEG-4. MPEG-2 is the best since it’s basically meant for DVD players.

## 3.	Best YouTube videos and other online streaming.

Most formats are currently supported by YouTube. However, I would prefer MP4, FLV, AVI and MOV for sharing. For IGTV, Facebook, twitter and other platform you should prioritise MP4 and MKV files.

## 4.	Best video formats for Websites

For your website, for greater user experience and loading speed, HTML5 and WEBM are the best. They are smaller in size hence a fast way for streaming. It will enhance a good visitors experience on your website.

With that, we can start enjoying our videos with ideal knowledge on their applications and mechanism.
